GeekyCamp 4.0 - Algorithms & Data Structures Lecture:

? problems for the advanced students
	! pesho.org problems
	* http://www.informatika.bg/interviews
	* traverse a matrix spirally

! read esprit's article on complexity

1. Algorithms complexity
	? pesho and marin's presentation
	* what is amortised complexity

2. Data structures
	* https://visualgo.net/en

	* stack
		- correct bracket sequnce problem
	
	* queue
		? implementation for exercise
	
	* list
		- vs array
		- arrayList
			- exact fit
			- expand by some blocksize
			- expand by doubling in size
		- linkedList (singly / doubly)

	* AVL tree
		- what's a tree, binary tree, full binary tree
		- binary search tree
		- self-balancing tree
		- https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html
	
	* hash tables
		-
			 AVL HashTable
	  insert log     1
	contains log     1
	  remove log     1
	  		      amortised?

	  	- separate chaining
	  		- with linked list (my impl)
	  		- with self-balancing BST (Java 8 HashMap impl)
	  	- open addressing (address does not corresponf to hash valu)e

	* java collections

3. Algorithms
	* sorting
		- what's in-place sorting, stable sorting
		? contingSort
		? bubbleSort
		- selectionSort
		- mergeSort
			- Divide and Conquer
			? iterative / recursive
		- quickSort 
			- how to choose the pivot
			- how to partition
			- complexity analysis
	
	* seraching
		- linear serach
		- binary search

	? Greedy algs

	* Graph algs
		- BFS
		- DFS
		- gps problem
